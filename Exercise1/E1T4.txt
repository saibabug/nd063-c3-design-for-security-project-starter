Poor security practices:
1. as per c3-app.yml all actions are allowed by application server on all s3 buckets.
This is a poor security practice as application server now has access to all s3 buckets and can delete update as well along with read access
This can be fixed by following least privilege principle

2. Public and private subnet network ACL rules allow all traffic on all ports from all ports.
The Web Service Instance is in the public subnet, has port 5000 open to the internet.
HTTPS port 443 is not open
Instance can be in private subnet to avoid exposed to internet and use port 443
and only allow communication on port 5000 from the AppLoadBalancerSG.
The DefaultPrivateRoute1 and DefaultPrivateRoute2 tables have DestinationCidrBlock: 0.0.0.0/0
Allowing incoming access by opening up ports for 0.0.0.0/0 in security groups is the most common mistake
made by professionals when provisioning resources.Users end up opening their cloud networks and exposing their cloud
resources and data to outside threats.
