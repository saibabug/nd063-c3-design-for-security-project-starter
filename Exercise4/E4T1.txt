Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.

1. Do not allow ssh from the public internet to the ec2 instances
2. Prevent root account login over SSH
3. enable password policy and MFA(for each user) at account level
4. Restrict other IPs which are allowed to communicate to application server by providing CIDR block or exact IP address.


Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket; even in the instance that API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data?

Restrict instance role policy to access the specific bucket(Free Recipe) that should be accessible from the application server.

Allow only specific actions like get object isntead of all actions in role policy

Enable server side encryption in the S3 buckets. This helps recipes are encrypted
