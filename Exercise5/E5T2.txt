identify tools that will allow you to do the following: a. Scan infrastructure as code templates. b. Scan AMI’s or containers for OS vulnerabilities. c. Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities.


1. Scan infrastructure as code templates.
         Terrascan - Use of SSL/TLS and proper configuration
2. Scan AMI’s or containers for OS vulnerabilities.
         Cloud Container attack tool(CCAT) - Cloud Container Attack Tool (CCAT) is a tool for testing security of container environments
            Example scenario to demonstrate the usage of CCAT:
Starting with compromised AWS credentials, the attacker enumerates and explores ECR repositories.
Then, the attacker found that they use NGINX Docker image and pulled that Docker image from ECR.
Furthermore, the attacker creates a reverse shell backdoor into the target Docker image. Finally, the attacker pushes the backdoored Docker image to ECR.

3. Scan infrastructure as code templates.
        - Checkov
            Checkov is a static code analysis tool for infrastructure-as-code. It scans cloud infrastructure managed in Terraform, Cloudformation, Kubernetes, Arm templates or Serverless Framework and detects misconfigurations.
4. Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities.
         AWS SecurityHub
            S3 buckets with public write or read permissions
